\section*{Who am I?}
I am a Junior undergraduate student pursuing a double major in Mathematical and Computational Biology at Harvey Mudd College and Philosophy at Claremont McKenna College. 
I am interested in any and all cross sections of these field. Beyond my extensive coursework, I am extremely involved in college extracurriculars. I help grade, tutor, and design many introduction classes at HMC. I have also contributed over a year of time to the HMC Bee Lab, and am currently in the process of publishing our findings.\\
\\
I want to heal the world with science, and am always looking for the next problem to tackle.
